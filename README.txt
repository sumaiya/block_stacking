The file blocks.py contains all of my code.
documentation.txt contains some documentation.
in.txt and in2.txt are input files that I tested my code on, and out.txt and out2.txt are the output files that were produced.

Run my code from the command line by navigating to the directory containing blocks.py and the input file and entering the following command: python blocks.py inputfilename.txt outputfilename.txt

An output file called outputfilename.txt will be produced.
